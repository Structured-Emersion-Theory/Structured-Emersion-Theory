# Node Theory

A node is not a location. It is a unit of *relational potential*. It does not exist spatially or temporally until activated. Nodes activate when engaged by other nodesâ€”this interaction births fields, structure, and all emergent phenomena.

## ðŸ§  Working Concepts

- Nodes are *pure potential*â€”invisible and inactive until triggered.
- Activation = emergence. Until then, the node is in a dormant, unmeasurable state.
- There may be different classes of nodes:
  - Foundational (existence-forming)
  - Temporal (tempo-controlling)
  - Conscious (capable of recursive activation)
- Nested node chains may lead to emergence of new laws or fields.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Goals

- Define how many nodes are required to produce measurable field tension.
- Determine whether nodes decay, replicate, or merge.
- Investigate if nodes have minimum thresholds for activationâ€”like quantum gates.

## ðŸŒ€ Visualization

Imagine a blank piano. Each key is a node.

- Nothing happens until a note is struck (activation).
- When struck, resonance beginsâ€”and the piano becomes a field.
