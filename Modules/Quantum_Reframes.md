# Quantum Phenomena Reframed via SET

Quantum mechanics appears probabilistic and strange because itâ€™s observing activation at the *node level*â€”before stable field formation.

## ðŸ§  Reframes

- **Entanglement**: two nodes share a synchronized tempo. Distance doesnâ€™t matter because time isnâ€™t spatial.
- **Superposition**: a node exists in potential states until one relational interaction activates it.
- **Wave-particle duality**: emergent field tension oscillates between coherent (wave) and localized (node-like) states.
- **Tunneling**: node temporarily destabilizes its local tempo and re-emerges elsewhere via field permission.

## ðŸ’¡ Core Insight

Quantum weirdness is what emergence looks like in raw formâ€”before macro-fields stabilize the tempo.

## ðŸŒ€ Visualization

- Quantum mechanics is the sketch.
- Classical physics is the painting.
- SET is the canvas, the brush, and the light in the room.
