# Theory Modules

This folder contains the core conceptual modules of Structured Emersion Theory (SET).

Each file presents a distinct yet connected domain:

- **Node Theory** – foundational units of relational potential
- **Field Collisions** – emergent dynamics from intersecting fields
- **Laws of Structure** – governing principles across all emergent behavior
- **Consciousness** – recursive activation and participatory field completion
- **Quantum Reframes** – reinterpretation of quantum behaviors using SET logic
- **Time & Tempo** – reframing time as rhythm, not coordinate
