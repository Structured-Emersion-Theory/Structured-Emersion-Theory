# Time as Emergent Tempo

Time is not a coordinate. It is a *local rhythm*—a tempo of relational change. High-activation zones feel “fast.” Dormant zones feel “still.”

## 🧠 Core Insights

- **Dilation** = local slowdown of relational tempo.
- **Collapse** = field interference canceling temporal rhythm.
- This reframes relativity: it’s not curvature, it’s tempo friction.
- There is no master clock. Only overlapping tempos across networked fields.

## 🌀 Visualization

- Think of time as the BPM (beats per minute) of the local field.
- Two adjacent areas with different BPMs will experience dilation when interacting.
- Consciousness may act as a tempo observer or synchronizer.

## 💡 Experimental Thought

- Could artificial tempo be introduced to manipulate time experience?
