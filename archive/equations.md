This document contains early formulations of SET's structural mathematics.

Most equations have been refined and promoted into `Equations.md`, with one notable exception.

## âœ… Already Promoted to Canon

- `Îº = Î”Î» / Î”d` â€” Structural redshift coefficient  
- `T_local = Tâ‚€ / (1 + R)` â€” Tempo shift in dense zones  
- `M = âˆ«â‚€^d Îº Â· C_f(x) dx` â€” Containment-based mass  
- `âˆ‚C/âˆ‚t < 0  and  C â†’ 0` â€” Collapse condition  
- `z = f(Îº Â· d)` â€” Generalized redshift model

## ðŸ“¥ Candidate for Inclusion

- `I(x, t) = Î£ [Ráµ¢(x, t) Â· Râ±¼(x, t)]` â€” Ripple Interference Matrix  
  Describes local interference energy from ripple overlap
