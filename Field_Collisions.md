# Field Convergence & Collision

When two or more relational fields interact, they produce:

- **Interference zones** (constructive or destructive)
- **Temporary null zones** (entropy spikes or data collapse)
- **Emergent third fields** (new behaviors)

## 🧠 Theories Under Construction

- Some field overlaps may spawn self-stabilizing emergent structures.
- Black holes may represent collapse into an “overlap field” — a field without structure but containing all prior tension.
- Field dominance may depend on:
  - Node density
  - Activation tempo
  - Stability of prior interactions

## 🌀 Visualization

- Two tuning forks vibrating in phase create resonance.
- Two dissonant frequencies cause chaos, silence, or redirection.

## 🛠️ Goal

Develop a field interaction map or “collision syntax” that can be used in simulation or predictive modeling.
