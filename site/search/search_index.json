Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo.</p> <p>Node A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference.</p> <p>Field A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental\u2014they are emergent and collapsible.</p> <p>Activation The state change of a node from potential to active due to structural contact. All emergence, ripple, or mass begins with activation.</p> <p>Ripple A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance.</p> <p>Flicker A localized, rhythmic node oscillation caused by stabilized interference. Flickers are the basis of coherent emergence (e.g., mass, time).</p> <p>Coherence The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain internal rhythm across space. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal death.</p> <p>Tempo The rate of local activation change. Time is not absolute\u2014it is the rhythm of structural behavior. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions.</p> <p>Collapse A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak.</p> <p>Structural Resistance The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history.</p> <p>Mass The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure.</p> <p>Structural Thickening An increase in local resistance and flicker stability due to nearby mass or field density. Thickened zones stabilize or trap form.</p> <p>Emergence The appearance of measurable form or behavior due to the interaction of activated nodes. All observable phenomena in SET are emergent.</p> <p>Equilibrium The structural drive to minimize internal tension. Ripples, flickers, and collapse all seek to restore equilibrium through form or dissipation.</p> <p>Consciousness A recursive structure capable of simulating field behavior internally. Consciousness arises when a system mirrors the activation logic of the structure itself.</p>"},{"location":"Glossary_Candidates/","title":"Glossary Candidates","text":"<p>\ud83d\udd39 Scale Invariance Definition: The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.

Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo. Node A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference. Field A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental\u2014they are emergent and collapsible. Activation The state change of a node from potential to active due to structural contact. All emergence, ripple, or mass begins with activation. Ripple A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance. Flicker A localized, rhythmic node oscillation caused by stabilized interference. Flickers are the basis of coherent emergence (e.g., mass, time). Coherence The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain internal rhythm across space. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal death. Tempo The rate of local activation change. Time is not absolute\u2014it is the rhythm of structural behavior. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions. Collapse A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak. Structural Resistance The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history. Mass The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure. Structural Thickening An increase in local resistance and flicker stability due to nearby mass or field density. Thickened zones stabilize or trap form. Emergence The appearance of measurable form or behavior due to the interaction of activated nodes. All observable phenomena in SET are emergent. Equilibrium The structural drive to minimize internal tension. Ripples, flickers, and collapse all seek to restore equilibrium through form or dissipation. Consciousness A recursive structure capable of simulating field behavior internally. Consciousness arises when a system mirrors the activation logic of the structure itself.</p> <p>The Laws of Structure Law 1 \u2013 Existence as Emergence Nothing exists independently. All observable phenomena emerge from the interaction of structure. Law 2 \u2013 Nodes as Relational Potentials A node is a unit of dormant potential that becomes active only through interaction. It has no fixed position in time or space until activated. Law 3 \u2013 Fields as Activated Structure Fields are not background substrates. They are coherent activation patterns among nodes, forming temporary structural tension networks. Law 4 \u2013 Time as Local Tempo Time is not a dimension. It is the local rate of relational activation. Tempo differs between regions due to structural pressure, density, or interference. Law 5 \u2013 Ripple Propagation Ripples are cascading node activations. They carry no mass or charge\u2014only interference potential. Ripple stability defines field strength. Law 6 \u2013 Flicker Coherence When ripple interference becomes regularized, it produces flickers\u2014oscillating activation loops. Stable flickers are precursors to mass and form. Law 7 \u2013 Structural Resistance and Redshift Redshift is not caused by recession velocity. It is a degradation of coherence due to structural resistance. Light does not stretch\u2014it loses integrity over distance. Law 8 \u2013 Structural Thickening Massive objects increase structural resistance in their vicinity. This thickening stabilizes flickers, alters local tempo, and allows form to persist in orbit. Law 9 \u2013 Mass as Containment Field Mass is not intrinsic. It is the resistance required to maintain flicker coherence within a localized activation zone. Law 10 \u2013 Contact Ignition A node activates only through field contact. Without contact, it remains inert. Without nodes, fields collapse. Law 11 \u2013 The Coherence Horizon The boundary of the observable universe is determined by loss of coherence\u2014not by light speed or expansion. Moving the observer changes the coherence limit. Law 12 \u2013 Imperfection and Emergence Perfect structure cannot generate complexity. All emergence originates in zones of incoherence or instability. Law 13 \u2013 Collapse and Field Reformation When field coherence exceeds threshold limits, local collapse occurs. Collapse is not destruction, but restructuring toward a new activation state. Law 14 \u2013 Equilibrium Drive All structural systems move toward equilibrium. Activation introduces tension; tension propagates or resolves through flicker, ripple, or collapse. Law 15 \u2013 Conscious Emergence Consciousness is recursive structural activation that simulates field behavior internally. It arises when a system mirrors the dynamics of its originating structure.</p>"},{"location":"modules/Node_Theory/","title":"Node Theory","text":"<p>A node is not a location.
