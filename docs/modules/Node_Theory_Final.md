# Node Theory (Canonical Core)

A node is not a location. It is a unit of *relational potential*. It does not exist spatially or temporally until activated. Nodes activate through interaction with other nodes—this interaction gives rise to fields, structure, and all emergent phenomena.

---

## Core Concepts

- Nodes are *pure potential*—invisible and inactive until structurally engaged.
- Activation = emergence. Until activation, the node remains dormant and unmeasurable.
- Nodes follow the principles set by:
  - *(Law 2: Nodes as Relational Potentials)*
  - *(Law 10: Contact Ignition)*
- Node behavior is governed by the activation equation:  
  `Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)`

---

## Research Objectives

- Quantify how many activated nodes are required to produce measurable field tension.
- Investigate whether nodes can decay, replicate, or merge under specific field conditions.
- Determine whether a threshold mechanism governs activation (e.g., quantum-like gates).
