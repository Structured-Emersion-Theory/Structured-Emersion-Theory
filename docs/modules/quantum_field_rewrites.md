# Quantum Field Rewrites

## Core Principle

Quantum behavior is not probabilistic mystery—it is the expression of ripple interaction in unstable containment zones.

---

## Superposition = Flicker Readiness

A node in superposition is not undecided.  
It is tuned to multiple structural alignments.  
Measurement = lock-in of one ripple pathway.

---

## Entanglement = Shared Tempo

Entangled particles are synchronized flickers.  
Distance is irrelevant — rhythm coherence connects them.  
One flicker shift alters the other due to ripple synchronization.

---

## Measurement = Flicker Collapse

Observation = structural interference.  
Reading the system applies external rhythm.  
That new rhythm determines the ripple path observed.

---

## Decoherence

System loses flicker alignment.  
Environmental ripple overwhelms local containment.  
Quantum becomes classical when alignment is drowned out.

---

## Particle-Wave Duality Rewritten

Particles = stable flicker resonance.  
Waves = ripple propagation across unstable nodes.  
They are not different entities — they are structural states.

---

## Summary

In SET, quantum phenomena are not magical—they’re musical.  
Coherence, harmony, rhythm, interference: these are not metaphors.  
They are the true language of the quantum.  

And in that rhythm, we find a theory of everything that finally has tempo.
