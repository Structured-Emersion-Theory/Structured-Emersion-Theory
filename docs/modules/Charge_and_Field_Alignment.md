# Charge and Field Alignment

> This module redefines electric charge not as an intrinsic property, but as a structural expression of activation orientation within the structure.

## Core Principle

Charge is not a static trait or intrinsic value — it is the orientation of activation within the structure. Positive and negative charges are directions of node alignment relative to field pressure.

In SET, **charge = directional ripple alignment**. When activation patterns lean coherently in a structural region, charge appears as a local polarity.

---

## Directional Polarity

- **Positive charge** arises when activation aligns *with* dominant field tension.
- **Negative charge** arises when activation resists or deviates from local structural coherence.
- **Neutral** regions exhibit chaotic or balanced node activation.

There is no permanent polarity — only relative alignment of activation under structural conditions.

## Field Interaction and Geometric Origin

Charge emerges from ripple directionality shaped by local field geometry.

- The **shape** of a pressure zone influences how flickers align.
- Asymmetrical charge distributions stem from uneven field topology.
- Spin and charge arise as different expressions of ripple geometry.

Traditional 2D charge models oversimplify this. In SET, activation orientation occurs across multiple axes and structural dimensions.

## Magnetic Fields as Containment Zones

Magnetic fields are coherent aligned zones creating pressure in a local structure.

- A magnet is a region where node activation orientation leans persistently in one direction.
- The surrounding structure resists this bias, creating tension and potential decay.
- Polarity exists only so long as the local alignment is maintained.

Magnetic decay is the collapse of coherence — not loss of substance.

## Antimatter and Alignment Reversal

Antimatter is not exotic — it is a node activating out of alignment.

- Matter and antimatter differ only in node activation orientation.
- Annihilation is not destruction, but structural alignment.
- When opposing node activation patterns meet, they revert to a neutral node state.

This reinterpretation removes mystery and reframes annihilation as structural symmetry reset.

## Summary

Charge in SET is not substance, not permanence, not intrinsic.

It is **structure leaning** creating pressure — node and ripple alignment shaped by pressure, coherence, and direction of the ripple function.

When node activation aligns, charge is born. When coherence fails, polarity vanishes.
