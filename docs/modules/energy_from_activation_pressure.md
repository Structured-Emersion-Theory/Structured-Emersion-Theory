# Energy from Activation Pressure

## Reframing Classical Energy

Einstein’s formulation:
**E = mc²**  
Energy is mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.

SET does not reject this — instead, it reframes why it works.

---

## SET Formulation

**E = Fₚ – Fᵣ**

Where:  
- **Fₚ** = node activation Pressure — the total emergent node activation force applied to a node by the structure  
- **Fᵣ** = Recognition Limit — the coherence threshold required to maintain mass stability  
- **E** = emergent energy as the overflow beyond mass stabilization

---

## Interpretation

- If **Fₚ = Fᵣ** → Stable mass exists  
- If **Fₚ > Fᵣ** → Excess node activation force radiates as energy  
- If **Fₚ < Fᵣ** → Node remains inactive or coherence fails

---

## Conceptual Shift

SET reframes energy not as a fundamental quantity, but as structural surplus:  
> Energy is pressure the structure can no longer hold.  
> Mass is pressure stabilized through node activation coherence.

---

## Classical Bridge

Under stable node activation containment:
> Fᵣ ≈ mc²

This makes Einstein’s formulation a derived special case of SET’s node activation dynamics.

---

## Consequences

- **Mass** is not intrinsic, but a structural phase of coherence.  
- **Energy** is not stored substance, but relational pressure overflow.  
- **c²** still emerges as a constraint on propagation, but no longer defines energy itself.

---

## Future Work

Explore whether various SET conditions yield classical values of c² when Fᵣ is expressed in ripple equations or resonance thresholds.
