# Coherence Threshold and Entropy

> This module defines coherence as a local structural resonance and reframes entropy as the dissipation of ripple fidelity across the structure.

## I. Coherence as Local Structural Rhythm

Coherence is a structural state in which node activations maintain stable relational alignment across space and time. Coherence enables ripple propagation, memory, and emergence by preserving signal integrity under structural conditions.


**Key factors affecting coherence:**
- Distance between nodes (`d`)
- Local Time (`T_f`)
- Information propagation velocity (`v`)
- Node density (`N`)
- Structural pressure (`P`)

## II. Coherence Propagation Equation

Let:

- `C(x,t)` = coherence at position `x` and time `t`
- `N` = number of active communicating nodes
- `d` = distance between nodes
- `v` = signal propagation velocity
- `T_f` = local time

Then:

```
C(x,t) ∝ N(x,t) / (1 + d / (v · T_f))
```

High coherence regions allow signals to travel farther. Low coherence leads to signal failure and information decay.

## III. Threshold Function for Ripple Dissipation 

Ripple propagation also depends on overcoming local structural inertia.

Let:

- `ρ` = ripple pressure (incoming activation strength)
- `σ` = structural failure 
- `C` = coherence threshold ratio

Then:

```
C = ρ / σ
```

- If `C ≥ 1`, the ripple survives and propagates.
- If `C < 1`, the ripple dissipates.

This threshold reflects the resistance of structural change.

## IV. Entropy as Structural Failure

In SET, entropy is not energy death — it is the loss of coherence.

- Entropy = Activation limit
- Emergence fails when node communication breaks down
- High entropy zones are structural failure — not destroyed, just silent

Fractal alignment = low entropy = long-range coherence  
High pattern mismatch = high entropy = no emergence

---

## Summary

Coherence is not a constant. It is a local permission.

Entropy is not destruction. It is structural silence (failure).

Where communication fails (no emergence), form dissolves over time.

Where activation stalls, structure holds.
