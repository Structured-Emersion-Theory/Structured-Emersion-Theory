# Field Convergence & Collision (Canonical Core)

When two or more relational fields interact, they produce:

- **Interference zones** (constructive or destructive)
- **Temporary null zones** (coherence disruption)
- **Emergent third fields** (new behavior patterns)

---

## Canonical Principles

- Field interactions are governed by:
  - Ripple interference (`I(x, t) = Σ [Rᵢ · Rⱼ]`)
  - Coherence persistence (`dC/dt = –λ_c · C`)
  - Pressure gradients and flicker thresholds

- The nature of the collision depends on:
  - Node density in overlapping regions
  - Activation tempo differences
  - Pre-existing structural resistance

- These outcomes define whether structure fuses, destabilizes, or collapses.

---

## Research Objectives

- Characterize boundary conditions that govern coherence collapse vs field fusion
- Model the geometry of destructive vs constructive interference in 2+ field systems
- Extend ripple-based dynamics to field-domain level convergence
