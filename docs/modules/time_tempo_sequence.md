# Time, Tempo, and Sequence

**Core Principle**  
Time is not a dimension. It is a localized tempo — the rhythm at which structure allows nodes to flicker. Sequence is not absolute; it is relative to local field conditions.

---

## Tempo = Flicker Rhythm

Tempo is the speed of relational change in a region of structure.

- High tempo = rapid flicker, fast causality  
- Low tempo = slow flicker, delayed interaction

---

## Time Dilation = Tempo Distortion

When a field compresses or stretches, it alters flicker rate.  
Gravity is a pressure zone that slows local tempo.  
Time dilation isn’t time bending — it’s rhythm shifting.

---

## No Absolute Time

There is no universal clock.  
Each region pulses at its own structural beat.  
The illusion of linear time is a byproduct of aligned tempo sequences.

---

## Sequence = Causality Pattern

Event order is not fixed — it’s relational.  
One node’s cause may be another node’s effect.  
Sequence is a lattice artifact, not a law.

---

## Closed Systems = Local Looping

In self-contained systems, tempo can echo.  
This enables memory, resonance, and feedback.  
These loops give rise to perception of time as duration.

---

## Summary

SET views time not as a river, but as a song — one that shifts tempo based on pressure, containment, and structure.  
The past and future are illusions of alignment.  
Only tempo exists. Only rhythm flows.  
Everything else is choreography in the lattice.
