## Node Activation & Behavior

- `Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)` — Node activation from local field potential φ, decay rate γ, and structural coefficient μ. *(Law 2: Nodes as Relational Potentials, Law 10: Contact Ignition)*  
- `If Σ R_in ≥ A_threshold and C ≥ C_min → Flicker` — Nodes activate (flicker) when ripple strength exceeds structural and coherence thresholds. *(Law 6: Flicker Coherence)*

## Ripple Dynamics

- `R(x, t) = α · (∂A/∂t) · (C(x, t) / S(x))` — Ripple amplitude depends on activation rate, coherence, and resistance. *(Law 5: Ripple Propagation, Law 3: Fields as Activated Structure)*  
- `Rᵢ(t) = Rᵢ(t–1) · e^(–λ · Δt)` — Ripple decays over time unless reinforced. *(Law 5: Ripple Propagation)*  
- `R_net = Σ [Rⱼ · cos(Δθⱼ)]` — Net ripple from multiple sources based on alignment. *(Law 5)*  
- `I(x, t) = Σ [Rᵢ(x, t) · Rⱼ(x, t)]` — Ripple interference at a point in space-time. *(Law 5, Law 3)*  
- `If Σ Rᵢ(t) ≥ F_macro within Δτ_c → Macrofield Emergence` — Macrofield forms when ripple coherence exceeds threshold. *(Law 1: Existence as Emergence)*

## Tempo & Time

- `T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)` — Local tempo as a function of structural resistance. *(Law 4: Time as Local Tempo, Law 7: Structural Resistance)*  
- `∂C/∂t < 0 and C → 0` — Collapse occurs as coherence decays. *(Law 13: Collapse and Field Reformation, Law 12: Imperfection and Emergence)*

## Mass & Structural Containment

- `M = ∫₀^d κ · C_f(x) dx` — Mass as integrated coherence resistance over distance. *(Law 9: Mass as Containment Field, Law 6: Flicker Coherence)*  
- `m_f = F_flicker / a_structure` — Flicker-based mass from force over area. *(Law 9)*

## Energy Forms

- `E_k = (1/2) · m_f · v_f²` — Kinetic energy from ripple velocity across structure. *(Law 9, Law 6)*  
- `E_p = P · d_s` — Potential energy as pressure over structural distance. *(Law 3)*  
- `𝓡(x, t) = Σ [Aᵢ · sin(ωᵢ t + θᵢ) · Cᵢ]` — Resonant fields from coherent node activation. *(Law 6)*

## Collapse & Field Reformation

- `If ρ(x, t) ≥ ρ_c and C(x, t) < C_min → Collapse` — Collapse triggered when density exceeds coherence support. *(Law 13: Collapse and Field Reformation)*  
- `dE_residual/dt = –λ · E_residual` — Residual energy loss over time. *(Law 13, Law 7)*  
- `Ψ(x, t) = E_residual · κ(x, t)` — Bounce threshold from residual energy × resistance. *(Law 13)*  
- `If Ψ ≥ Ψ_min → Reformation` — Structural reformation triggers when bounce threshold is crossed. *(Law 13)*

## Consciousness & Thresholds

- `C_r = n · η · γ ≥ Θ_c` — Consciousness emerges when structure simulates field behavior. *(Law 15: Conscious Emergence)*

---

## Redshift & Cosmological Pressure

- `κ = Δλ / Δd` — Redshift as coherence drag. *(Law 7: Structural Resistance and Redshift)*  
- `z = (λ_obs – λ₀) / λ₀ = κ · d · P_H` — Redshift from resistance and pressure, not velocity. *(Law 7, Law 11: Coherence Horizon)*  
- `z = f(κ · d)` — Generalized structural redshift model. *(Law 7)*

---

## Structural Pressure & Force

- `P = F / A` — Structural pressure from force over activated area. *(Law 7: Structural Resistance, Law 8: Structural Thickening)*

---

## Simulation Logic (Rules)

- `Ripple Update:` If Σ R_in ≥ A_threshold and C ≥ C_min → Flicker → send ripple to neighbors and log time/memory. *(Law 6: Flicker Coherence, Law 10: Contact Ignition)*
