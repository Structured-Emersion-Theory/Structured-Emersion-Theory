ðŸ”¹ Scale Invariance
Definition:
The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.
Quantum behaviors and cosmological phenomena emerge from the same foundational activation mechanisms, modulated only by local tempo, density, and resistance.

Note:
This supports the idea that flicker, ripple, and coherence logic are scale-agnostic, making SET a fractally consistent framework.

ðŸ”¹ Simulation Potential
Definition:
The capacity for SET to be expressed entirely in structural and mathematical terms, without dependence on particle models or traditional physical fields.

Note:
This supports SET's testability and falsifiability through simulation enginesâ€”defining fields, mass, and time purely via activation logic and coherence behavior.
