# Structured Emersion Theory
## GitHub Canon Integration Protocol (GCIP)

---

### ✅ Step 1: Verify GitHub Canon Mirror Is Synced

Before any file is reviewed:
- Confirm the GitHub mirror at:
  > `https://structured-emersion-theory.github.io/Structured-Emersion-Theory/`
  reflects the **most current state** of the repository.
- Ensure all canonical files are present:
  - `Laws_of_Structure.md`
  - `Equations.md`
  - `Glossary.md`
  - Finalized module `.md` files

---

### ✅ Step 2: Intake File Classification

For each incoming file:
1. Classify its type:
   - `module` (theory, mechanic, or principle)
   - `doc` (white paper, glossary, reflection, etc.)
   - `sim` (simulation logic or system code)
   - `candidate` (equation, glossary, or law candidate)
2. Assign target directory:
   - `/modules/`
   - `/docs/`
   - `/sim/`
   - `/archive/` (for deprecated material)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Canon Logic Scrub

Each new file is reviewed against the following canonical documents:
- `Equations.md`
- `Glossary.md`
- `Laws_of_Structure.md`
- Existing `/modules/`

Checks performed:
- Redundancy: Is this already expressed elsewhere?
- Conflict: Does it contradict canon?
- Drift: Does it reflect outdated terminology?
- Omission: Does it define a concept or mechanic that belongs in the glossary, equations, or laws?

Action items:
- New glossary terms → `Glossary_Candidates.md`
- New or inconsistent equations → `Equation_Candidates.md`
- New foundational claims → `Law_Candidates.md`

---

### ✅ Step 4: Clean Formatting & Commit Prep

If file passes logic scrub:
- Convert to Markdown `.md`
- Remove non-canon headers/footers unless essential
- Apply SET format standards:
  - CamelCase filenames
  - Sentence-cased section headers
  - Inline canonical references (e.g., _[see Law 7]_) when relevant

---

### ✅ Step 5: GitHub Commit Guidelines

On commit:
- Place in correct repo directory
- Use descriptive commit message:
  ```
  Add [filename] to [folder]: [summary]
  ```
  Example: `Add RippleDecay.md to modules: defines ripple dissipation over time`

If file replaces another:
- Move old version to `/archive/`
- Note replacement in commit message

---

### ✅ Step 6: Update Canon Mirror

After pushing to GitHub:
- Update GitHub Pages mirror:
  > `https://structured-emersion-theory.github.io/Structured-Emersion-Theory/`
- Confirm new file is visible and linked
- Ensure folder views or manual indexes are consistent (if applicable)

---

### ✅ Step 7: Final Coherence Review (Optional)

For major milestones or releases:
- Re-run a full structure-wide coherence pass:
  - All modules
  - `Glossary.md`
  - `Equations.md`
  - `Laws_of_Structure.md`
- Confirm no conflicting terms, concepts, or math remain

---

This protocol ensures Structural Emersion Theory remains testable, logically unified, and transparently maintained as a living research project.
