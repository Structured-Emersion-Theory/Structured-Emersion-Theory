# Structured Emersion Theory – White Paper (Draft)

## Abstract

Structured Emersion Theory (SET) proposes a unified model of emergence grounded in node activation and relational field dynamics. SET replaces coordinate-based physical systems with tempo-driven, structure-based interactions. This draft outlines the core assumptions, mechanics, and falsifiable predictions.

## Introduction

(Insert overview of the classical limitations and motivation for SET...)

## Theory Overview

(Insert a brief summary of node theory, field interaction, tempo, and collapse...)

## Implications

(Sections on quantum interpretation, gravity reframing, time dilation, etc.)

## Testing Proposals

(Outline simulation or observational experiments)

## Conclusion

SET aims to explain not just what exists—but *how* and *why* structure appears at all.
