# Charge and Field Alignment

## 🧠 Reframed Principle

In SET, **charge** is not a fundamental property — it is the **directional bias of ripple activation** within a local field.

---

## 🔁 Charge as Structural Behavior

- **Positive charge**: ripple flicker aligns *with* dominant structural tension  
- **Negative charge**: ripple flicker opposes dominant tension  
- **Neutral**: unaligned or chaotic ripple structure

Charge is not inherent — it is **contextual**, depending on the surrounding structural rhythm and coherence field.

---

## 🧲 Polarity and Field Zones

- Structural regions with consistent flicker direction exhibit **polarity**
- These regions can trap ripples or repel incoherent ones
- **Field polarity** is a byproduct of **coherence asymmetry** in node networks

---

## ⚛️ Antimatter in SET

SET interprets antimatter not as negative particles but as **flickers facing against the dominant tempo**.

- Antimatter ripples travel *backward* through the tempo field  
- Annihilation is a collapse of flickers moving in inverse rhythms

---

## 🔍 Implications

- Charge is emergent from ripple orientation  
- Polarity is a local alignment effect  
- Opposing ripple directions create containment, resistance, and collapse behaviors

---

## 📘 Glossary Additions (Proposed)

- **Charge**: The directional alignment of ripple activation within a local field.  
- **Polarity**: Structural asymmetry where flicker coherence favors a particular direction.
