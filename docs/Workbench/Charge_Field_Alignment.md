# Charge and Field Alignment

This file contains exploratory scaffolding for understanding charge as an emergent property of field asymmetry and node alignment within structured resistance. This is not a finalized module or canonized law.

---

## Hypothesis

Charge behavior may not be a fundamental property, but rather an artifact of local activation skew. When activation occurs in asymmetric field geometries, node interactions appear biased toward either attraction or repulsion depending on resistance gradients.

Proposed mechanisms include:
- Field line overlap causing directional tension
- Net field curvature establishing interaction bias
- Discrete coherence gaps acting as charge carriers

## Canonical Dependencies

- Law 3 – Fields as Activated Structure  
- Law 5 – Ripple Propagation  
- Law 7 – Structural Resistance

---

## Notes

This file is intended to support future test equations for:
- Charge–field coupling behavior  
- High-resistance pulse deflection  
- Possible unification with ripple vector modeling

Field alignment is treated here as a structural state, not an intrinsic particle property.
