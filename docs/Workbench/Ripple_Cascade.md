# Ripple and Cascade Definitions

## 🔁 Ripple

A **ripple** is a single instance of structural activation—  
the flicker from one node to its neighbor across the lattice.

It is the **minimum unit of causal propagation** in SET.

### Characteristics:
- **Local** — confined to adjacent node interaction
- **Discrete** — quantized in timing and space
- **Directional** — flows across structural potential
- **Tempo-bound** — constrained by local activation rhythm

---

## 🌊 Cascade

A **cascade** is a sustained, coherent chain of ripple propagation  
through multiple nodes in rhythm.

It is an **emergent structure** dependent on coherence and tempo.

### Characteristics:
- **Emergent** — not constructed, but stabilized by rhythm
- **Coherence-bound** — can fail in high entropy zones
- **Field-forming** — can generate macrofield behavior
- **Sensitive to structure** — influenced by pressure, density, alignment

## 🧠 Entropic Collapse

Cascades may fail if:
- Local resistance exceeds ripple coherence
- Structural pressure introduces interference
- Tempo misalignment disrupts rhythm

This transition from cascade to noise is a key expression of **entropy** in SET.

## 📘 Glossary Additions (Proposed)

- **Cascade**: A coherent ripple chain across multiple nodes. Represents emergent structural propagation and field formation.
