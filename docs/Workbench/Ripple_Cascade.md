# Ripple and Cascade Definitions

This file refines the conceptual boundary between ripple propagation and activation cascades within SET. It is not a formal glossary or mathematical structure yet.

---

## Hypothesis

Although both ripple and cascade behaviors involve energy transfer through structure, they differ in activation logic and propagation shape.

- **Ripple** — a coherent, wave-like transmission of activation across adjacent nodes, typically governed by resistance and coherence thresholds.
- **Cascade** — a threshold-triggered activation chain where one node’s flicker initiates multi-node activation beyond immediate adjacency.

This distinction matters for modeling:
- Collapse behaviors  
- Field breakdown  
- Long-range emergent order

## Canonical Dependencies

- Law 5 – Ripple Propagation  
- Law 6 – Flicker Coherence  
- Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

## Notes

Future symbolic modeling may formalize ripple via differential equations and cascade via graph-based topology. This file will serve as a staging area for such definitions once math scaffolding is stable.
