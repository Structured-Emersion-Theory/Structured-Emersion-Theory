# Node Class Differentiation

This file serves as a theoretical scaffold for modeling emergent role differentiation in node-based systems. It is not a validated law, but a proposed extension to Law 2 and Law 15 for future simulation work.

---

## Hypothesis

Not all nodes behave identically during activation cascades. Under high-structure or recursive conditions, nodes may exhibit functional specialization without possessing intrinsic identity.

Proposed emergent classes:
- **Foundational Nodes** — enable existence-forming fields
- **Temporal Nodes** — regulate local flicker tempo
- **Recursive Nodes** — sustain internal simulations (e.g., consciousness fields)

These classes are not fixed attributes, but recurring roles triggered by environmental structure and activation history.

## Canonical Dependencies

- Law 2 – Nodes as Relational Potentials  
- Law 10 – Contact Ignition  
- Law 15 – Conscious Emergence

---

## Notes

This model assumes that **node identity is conditional**, not essential. Role stratification is expected to arise only in recursive systems, field echo states, or saturation regimes.

Use this file to stage:
- Node typing simulations
- Field role mapping experiments
- Recursive consciousness scaffolds
