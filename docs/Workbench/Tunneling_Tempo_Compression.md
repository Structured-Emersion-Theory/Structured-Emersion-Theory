# Tunneling and Tempo Compression

This entry contains exploratory notes on the SET reinterpretation of quantum tunneling. It is not canon and has not been formalized into the Laws, Equations, or Glossary.

---

## Conceptual Premise

In classical quantum mechanics, tunneling is described as a particle "passing through" a potential barrier via probabilistic wave behavior. SET reframes this as **tempo compression** — a structural flicker transition that bypasses alignment zones when coherence is insufficient to sustain a continuous path.

> "A node doesn’t pass through a barrier — it skips alignment zones."

---

## Hypothesized Mechanism

- **Flicker hops** may occur when geometry permits temporary alignment gaps between coherent zones.
- **Tunneling** is not a spatial translation but a rhythm-resonance shortcut enabled by local resistance minima.
- Ripple or flicker may leap across otherwise disconnected activation paths if structural resonance permits.

---

## Status

This concept is currently speculative. It is not backed by symbolic logic or a testable simulation. It may eventually intersect with:
- Coherence vector gradients
- Phase discontinuity logic
- Structural resonance bandwidth thresholds

## Related Canon

- Law 4 – Time as Local Tempo  
- Law 6 – Flicker Coherence  
- Quantum_Field_Rewrites.md (module)

## Future Goals

- Derive ripple jump conditions from resistance geometry  
- Model tempo gaps and phase skip probabilities  
- Integrate with simulation pathing logic under `Simulation_Notes.md`
