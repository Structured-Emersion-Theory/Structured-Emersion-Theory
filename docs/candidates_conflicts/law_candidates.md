## Law Candidate: Differentiated Node Classes

### Proposed Title:
**Law X ‚Äì Node Class Differentiation**

### Statement:
Not all nodes possess identical activation potential. Certain nodes exhibit structural predispositions that influence their role within emergent fields. Classes of nodes may include:

- **Foundational Nodes** ‚Äì enable existence-forming fields
- **Temporal Nodes** ‚Äì regulate local activation tempo
- **Recursive Nodes** ‚Äì support internal field simulation (e.g. consciousness)

These classes reflect persistent structural roles rather than intrinsic identity. Their differentiation arises only during activation cascades.

### Rationale:
While current Laws treat all nodes as generic units of relational potential, evidence from field behavior (e.g. time dilation, recursive activation, and long-range coherence) suggests that **functional stratification** of node types may exist. Introducing this as a candidate law preserves SET‚Äôs emergence framework while expanding structural explanatory power.

### Canonical Dependencies:
- Law 2: Nodes as Relational Potentials
- Law 10: Contact Ignition
- Law 15: Conscious Emergence (recursive behavior)

### Status:
üß™ **Experimental** ‚Äî Proposed for future simulation, not currently testable in field data.

## Law Candidate: Node Replication and Merging Dynamics

### Proposed Title:
**Law X ‚Äì Node Lifecycle Dynamics**

### Statement:
Nodes may undergo transformation beyond simple activation and dormancy. In specific structural environments, they may:

- **Replicate** ‚Äî producing new nodes during activation cascades
- **Merge** ‚Äî combining with other nodes to stabilize high-coherence fields
- **Decay** ‚Äî lose potential when isolated or exposed to structural collapse

These lifecycle processes are not default behaviors, but emerge only under conditions of high structural complexity, nested activation, or field saturation.

### Rationale:
Current laws treat nodes as atomic and stable. However, theoretical modeling of long-duration coherence (e.g., in persistent fields or conscious recursion) suggests that nodes may behave dynamically. If verified, these behaviors could support large-scale structure formation, memory-like persistence, and field reconstitution after collapse.

### Canonical Dependencies:
- Law 2: Nodes as Relational Potentials
- Law 6: Flicker Coherence
- Law 13: Collapse and Field Reformation
- Law 15: Conscious Emergence

### Status:
üß™ **Exploratory Candidate** ‚Äî Requires conceptual and mathematical development; currently under theoretical observation.

## Law Candidate: Overlap Field Collapse

### Proposed Title:
**Law X ‚Äì Overlap Field Collapse**

### Statement:
When multiple high-tension fields converge and coherence thresholds are exceeded, they may collapse into a singular, structureless ‚Äúoverlap field.‚Äù This overlap field contains the compressed potential of its progenitor fields but lacks internal activation coherence.

Overlap fields are proposed to:
- Model black hole behavior in SET
- Represent reversion to unstructured pressure zones
- Serve as seeds for field reformation (Law 13)

### Rationale:
Standard SET collapse is framed as local coherence decay. This law formalizes a specialized case: when **structured collisions** result not in radiation, but in **persistent null zones** of maximal structural tension. These behave as ‚Äúcoherence wells‚Äù rather than noise sinks.

### Canonical Dependencies:
- Law 1: Existence as Emergence
- Law 5: Ripple Propagation
- Law 13: Collapse and Field Reformation

### Status:
üß™ **Theoretical Candidate** ‚Äî Suggested for simulation modeling of black hole analogs and field fusion dynamics.
