### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G01  
**Term:** Scale Invariance  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.  
Quantum behaviors and cosmological phenomena emerge from the same foundational activation mechanisms, modulated only by local tempo, density, and resistance.

**Note:**  
This supports the idea that flicker, ripple, and coherence logic are scale-agnostic, making SET a fractally consistent framework.

### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G02  
**Term:** Simulation Potential  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The capacity for SET to be expressed entirely in structural and mathematical terms, without dependence on particle models or traditional physical fields.

**Note:**  
This supports SET's testability and falsifiability through simulation engines‚Äîdefining fields, mass, and time purely via activation logic and coherence behavior.

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending Review

### Tempo

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** New Term  

**Definition:**  
The local rhythm at which structure allows nodes to flicker. Tempo governs the rate of relational change and defines how quickly causality propagates in a region of structure.

**Notes:**  
SET treats tempo as a physical phenomenon, not a metaphor. Distinct from general relativity‚Äôs ‚Äútime,‚Äù tempo varies with resistance and containment. High tempo = fast interaction; low tempo = slow causality.

---

### Sequence

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** New Framing  

**Definition:**  
The observed order of events relative to local structural tempo. Sequence is not fixed or absolute; it emerges from lattice relationships and tempo alignment.

**Notes:**  
SET reframes causality as relational rather than universal. Sequence is not a temporal axis, but a rhythm-dependent artifact of field interaction.

---

### Time Dilation (SET)

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** Reinterpreted Physics Term  

**Definition:**  
A distortion of local tempo caused by pressure or resistance in the structure. Instead of time stretching or bending, SET asserts that flicker rhythm slows under compression.

**Notes:**  
Redefines general relativity‚Äôs explanation of time dilation. In SET, changes in flicker rate cause differential tempo, not warping of a temporal dimension.

---

### Temporal Coherence

**Source:** `temporal_coherence_and_time.md`  
**Status:** New Term  

**Definition:**  
The alignment of local flicker rhythms across nodes or regions of structure. Temporal coherence indicates structural synchronization in time-like behavior without requiring a global clock.

**Notes:**  
This term captures the SET view that time is a distributed rhythm, not a dimension. Coherence governs resonance, alignment, and causality in localized fields.

---

### Resonant Flicker

**Source:** `temporal_coherence_and_time.md`  
**Status:** New Term (Renamed from ‚ÄúFlicker Resonance‚Äù)  

**Definition:**  
Self-sustaining flicker patterns within a closed structure that reinforce over time, enabling memory and internal continuity.

**Notes:**  
Used to explain how perception and memory emerge from flicker-based resonance, particularly in contained systems like consciousness fields.

---

### Structural Trace

**Source:** `temporal_coherence_and_time.md`  
**Status:** New Term (Renamed from ‚ÄúRipple Path‚Äù)  

**Definition:**  
The visible or calculable imprint left by past node interactions within a structure. A record of flicker progression through space and resistance.

**Notes:**  
Replaces the metaphor-heavy ‚Äúripple path‚Äù with a more precise structural mapping. Suggests time is the afterimage of pressure-altered structure.

---

### Perceived Irreversibility

**Source:** `temporal_coherence_and_time.md`  
**Status:** New Framing  

**Definition:**  
The appearance of a forward-moving timeline caused by increasing entropy and the degradation of flicker coherence.

**Notes:**  
SET reframes entropy not as a global arrow of time, but as a local loss of structural fidelity. Time does not move ‚Äî structure decays.
