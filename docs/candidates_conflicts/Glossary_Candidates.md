### Entry ID: 2025-07-21-G01  
**Term:** Ripple Storm  
**Type:**  New Entry

**Definition:**  
> A turbulent ripple interference field generated near collapse zones. Often theorized to create the chaotic geometric conditions necessary for galaxy formation. Arises from structural instability around containment collapse and silence fields.

**Note:**  
- Describes ripple behavior following containment failure (Law 13, Law 15)
- Appears in `Black_Holes_and_Galaxies.md` module
- Not yet supported by simulation data; reserved for future modeling

**Status:**  Pending Review
