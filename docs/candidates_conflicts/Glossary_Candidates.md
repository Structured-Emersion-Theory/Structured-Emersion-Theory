### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G01  
**Term:** Scale Invariance  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.  
Quantum behaviors and cosmological phenomena emerge from the same foundational activation mechanisms, modulated only by local tempo, density, and resistance.

**Note:**  
This supports the idea that flicker, ripple, and coherence logic are scale-agnostic, making SET a fractally consistent framework.

### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G02  
**Term:** Simulation Potential  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The capacity for SET to be expressed entirely in structural and mathematical terms, without dependence on particle models or traditional physical fields.

**Note:**  
This supports SET's testability and falsifiability through simulation engines‚Äîdefining fields, mass, and time purely via activation logic and coherence behavior.

### Tempo

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** New Term  

**Definition:**  
The local rhythm at which structure allows nodes to flicker. Tempo governs the rate of relational change and defines how quickly causality propagates in a region of structure.

**Notes:**  
SET treats tempo as a physical phenomenon, not a metaphor. Distinct from general relativity‚Äôs ‚Äútime,‚Äù tempo varies with resistance and containment. High tempo = fast interaction; low tempo = slow causality.

### Sequence

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** New Framing  

**Definition:**  
The observed order of events relative to local structural tempo. Sequence is not fixed or absolute; it emerges from lattice relationships and tempo alignment.

**Notes:**  
SET reframes causality as relational rather than universal. Sequence is not a temporal axis, but a rhythm-dependent artifact of field interaction.

---

### Time Dilation (SET)

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** Reinterpreted Physics Term  

**Definition:**  
A distortion of local tempo caused by pressure or resistance in the structure. Instead of time stretching or bending, SET asserts that flicker rhythm slows under compression.

**Notes:**  
Redefines general relativity‚Äôs explanation of time dilation. In SET, changes in flicker rate cause differential tempo, not warping of a temporal dimension.
