### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G01  
**Term:** Scale Invariance  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.  
Quantum behaviors and cosmological phenomena emerge from the same foundational activation mechanisms, modulated only by local tempo, density, and resistance.

**Note:**  
This supports the idea that flicker, ripple, and coherence logic are scale-agnostic, making SET a fractally consistent framework.

### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G02  
**Term:** Simulation Potential  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The capacity for SET to be expressed entirely in structural and mathematical terms, without dependence on particle models or traditional physical fields.

**Note:**  
This supports SET's testability and falsifiability through simulation engines‚Äîdefining fields, mass, and time purely via activation logic and coherence behavior.
