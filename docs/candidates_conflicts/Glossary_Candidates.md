### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G01  
**Term:** Scale Invariance  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The principle that SET dynamics apply across all structural scales.  
Quantum behaviors and cosmological phenomena emerge from the same foundational activation mechanisms, modulated only by local tempo, density, and resistance.

**Note:**  
This supports the idea that flicker, ripple, and coherence logic are scale-agnostic, making SET a fractally consistent framework.

### Entry ID: 2025-07-19-G02  
**Term:** Simulation Potential  
**Type:** üì• New Entry  
**Definition:**  
The capacity for SET to be expressed entirely in structural and mathematical terms, without dependence on particle models or traditional physical fields.

**Note:**  
This supports SET‚Äôs testability and falsifiability through simulation engines‚Äîdefining fields, mass, and time purely via activation logic and coherence behavior.

## Term Candidate: Nested Node Chain

### Proposed Term:
**Nested Node Chain**

### Draft Definition:
A structured sequence of node activations in which the coherence of one activation chain becomes the activation condition for the next. These chains allow for the emergence of secondary or tertiary structural layers beyond the original flicker or ripple pattern.

Nested chains are a proposed mechanism for:
- Hierarchical emergence (e.g. multi-field systems)
- Meta-structural recursions (e.g. awareness of awareness)
- Field convergence thresholds

### Rationale:
This candidate introduces a language handle for complex coherence behaviors already implied by flicker chaining and recursive activation in Laws 6 and 15. As SET modeling scales toward consciousness and macro-simulation, nested chain resolution may offer a clear metric for distinguishing emergent systems from mere aggregates.

### Canonical Touchpoints:
- Law 6: Flicker Coherence
- Law 15: Conscious Emergence
- Consciousness_Field module (proposed for further elaboration)

### Status:
üß™ **Conceptual Term** ‚Äî Under consideration for future field structuring modules.

## Term Candidate: Temporal Node

### Proposed Term:
**Temporal Node**

### Draft Definition:
A hypothesized subclass of node that governs or modulates local activation tempo. Temporal nodes may act as regulators of time-like behavior within coherent structures, affecting the rhythm of activation cycles without directly initiating structural change themselves.

These nodes are not time-keepers but **tempo influencers**‚Äîtheir presence or density alters local activation rate, coherence persistence, and ripple speed.

### Rationale:
The SET framework defines time as emergent tempo (Law 4). If structure can locally alter tempo via resistance or coherence, then dedicated node types with tempo-regulating influence may exist. These could serve as foundational units in gravitational or relativistic systems.

### Canonical Dependencies:
- Law 4: Time as Local Tempo
- Law 7: Structural Resistance
- Law 8: Structural Thickening

### Status:
üß™ **Experimental Term** ‚Äî No direct canonical confirmation; proposed for simulation.
