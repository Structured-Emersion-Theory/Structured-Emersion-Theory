### Entry ID: 2025-07-21-G01  
**Term:** Ripple Storm  
**Type:**  New Entry

**Definition:**  
> A turbulent ripple interference field generated near collapse zones. Often theorized to create the chaotic geometric conditions necessary for galaxy formation. Arises from structural instability around containment collapse and silence fields.

**Note:**  
- Describes ripple behavior following containment failure (Law 13, Law 15)
- Appears in `Black_Holes_and_Galaxies.md` module
- Not yet supported by simulation data; reserved for future modeling

**Status:**  Pending Review

### Entry ID: 2025-07-22-G02  
**Term:** Magnetic Containment Zone  
**Type:** 📥 New Entry

**Definition:**  
> A region of structure where coherent flicker alignment persists under local resistance. Magnetic fields in SET are modeled as dynamic containment zones of directional flicker, not as static field lines or intrinsic properties.

**Note:**  
- Introduced in `Charge_and_Field_Alignment.md`
- Reframes magnetism as a flicker alignment effect
- Requires future simulation for full validation

**Status:** ⏳ Pending Review
