### Tempo = Flicker Rhythm

**Source:** `time_tempo_sequence.md`  
**Status:** Conceptual Identity  

**Description:**  
Defines tempo as the measurable rate at which structural nodes flicker in a given region. Suggests that all temporal experience emerges from local structural rhythm.

**Notes:**  
This expression is foundational to SET’s redefinition of time. It reframes perceived time flow as a rhythm governed by structure rather than as an external dimension.  
Requires formalization into testable flicker-frequency equations.

**Conflicts:**  
None detected in `Equations.md`
