This is a Structured Emersion Theory (SET) canonical validation task.

Use only the files listed in the canonical integration index:
https://structured-emersion-theory.github.io/Structured-Emersion-Theory/Integration_Protocol/

All content I provide must be evaluated against that GitHub mirror. That index reflects the live canon.

Follow the Structured Emersion Theory Integration Protocol:

Phase 1: Audit intent, extract terms, detect equations  
Phase 2: Validate against canon (glossary, laws, equations)  
Phase 3: Reformat and assign correct file path within the GitHub  
Phase 4 (optional): Log glossary, law, or equation candidates if needed

Glossary entries must match `Glossary.md`.  
Equations must be in `Equations.md` or logged as candidates.  
All laws must match `Laws_of_Structure.md` exactly.  
No prior memory, no model assumptions â€” only use the URLs in the integration index.

Do not approve or format content unless it has been fully validated against canon.
