## Node Activation & Behavior

- `Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)`  
  Node activation from local field φ with decay rate γ and coupling constant μ. *(Law 2, Law 10)*

- `Θ(Σ R_in – A_threshold) · Θ(C – C_min) = 1`  
  Node activation condition using ripple input and coherence threshold. *(Law 6)*

## Ripple Dynamics

- `R(x, t) = α · (∂A/∂t) · (C(x, t) / S(x))`  
  Ripple amplitude as function of activation rate, coherence, and resistance. *(Law 5, Law 3)*

- `Rᵢ(t) = Rᵢ(t–1) · e^(–λ · Δt)`  
  Ripple decay over time. *(Law 5)*

- `R_net = Σ [Rⱼ · cos(Δθⱼ)]`  
  Net ripple strength from angular summation. *(Law 5)*

- `I(x, t) = Σ [Rᵢ(x, t) · Rⱼ(x, t)]`  
  Interference at a point in space-time. *(Law 3, Law 5)*

## Time

- `τ_local = τ₀ / (1 + R)`  
  Local time is inversely proportional to structural resistance. As resistance increases, time slows. *(Law 4, Law 7)*

- `dC/dt = –λ_c · C`  
  Coherence decay modeled as exponential function. *(Law 13, Law 12)*

## Mass and Gravity

- `m = dP/da`  
  Structural mass as pressure resistance to acceleration. *(Law 9)*

- `F_g = –∇P_s`  
  Gravitational force as pressure gradient. *(Law 9, Law 7)*

- `U_g = –∫ P_s(x) dx`  
  Gravitational potential from structural pressure. *(Law 7)*

## Energy and Activation Pressure

- `E = Fₚ – Fᵣ`  
  Emergent energy is the difference between activaion pressure and the structural recognition limit. When flicker pressure exceeds this threshold, surplus energy is released. When they are equal, mass is stable.  
  *(Law 6, Law 9, Law 13)*

- `E_k = (1/2) · m · v²`  
  Ripple kinetic energy. *(Law 6, Law 9)*

- `E_p = P_s · d_s`  
  Potential energy as product of pressure and distance. *(Law 7)*

- `E = P_s · V · γ`  
  Total energy of coherence field based on structure volume. *(Law 3)*

---

## Redshift and Field Dispersion

- `z = (λ_obs – λ₀) / λ₀ = κ · d · P_H`  
  Redshift as function of distance and background field pressure. *(Law 14)*

---

## Entropy and Coherence States

- `S = k_s · ln(Ω_s)`  
  Structural entropy based on number of coherent configurations. *(Law 12)*

---

## Coherence Threshold and Propagation

- `C(x,t) ∝ N(x,t) / (1 + d / (v · T_f))`  
  Local coherence is proportional to node density and inversely proportional to distance, propagation velocity, and local tempo. Defines the spatial structure of coherence across a ripple path. *(Law 4, Law 6, Law 13)*

- `C = ρ / σ`  
  The coherence threshold condition: ripple pressure (ρ) must exceed structural failure pressure (σ) for a signal to propagate. If `C < 1`, the ripple collapses. *(Law 6, Law 13, Law 15)*
