# Glossary of Core Terms

This glossary defines the primary concepts and terms used in the SET framework. Key terms are linked to equations or laws where applicable to aid in formal review.

**Structure**  
A foundational, continuous relational lattice. Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo.  
Related: Node, Coherence, Ripple

---

**Node**  
A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference.  
Related: Law 2 – Nodes as Relational Potentials, Law 10 – Contact Ignition

---

**Field**  
A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental—they are emergent and collapsible.  
Related: Law 3 – Fields as Activated Structure

---

**Activation**  
The state change of a node from potential to active due to structural contact. All emergence, ripple, or mass begins with activation.  
Related: Equation – Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)

---

**Ripple**  
A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance.  
Related: Law 5 – Ripple Propagation, Equations – R(x, t), Rᵢ(t), R_net

---

**Flicker**  
A localized, rhythmic node oscillation caused by stabilized interference. Flickers are the basis of coherent emergence (e.g., mass, time).  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence

---

**Coherence**  
The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain internal rhythm across space. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal death.  
Related: Law 6, Law 7, Law 13, Equation – dC/dt = –λ_c · C

---

**Tempo**  
The rate of local activation change. Time is not absolute—it is the rhythm of structural behavior. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions.  
Related: Law 4 – Time as Local Tempo, Equation – T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)

---

**Collapse**  
A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak.  
Related: Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Structural Resistance**  
The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history.  
Related: Law 7 – Structural Resistance and Redshift, Equation – F_g = –∇P_s

---

**Mass**  
The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure.  
Related: Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field, Equation – m = dP/da

---

**Structural Thickening**  
An increase in local resistance due to mass or field saturation. Thickening stabilizes flickers, slows tempo, and alters the behavior of nearby structures.  
Related: Law 8 – Structural Thickening

---

**Redshift**  
A degradation in signal coherence over distance. SET interprets redshift as coherence loss, not velocity.  
Related: Law 7, Equation – z = κ · d · P_H

---

**Entropy**  
A structural measure of potential configuration states. As systems lose coherence, the number of possible node arrangements increases.  
Related: Law 12 – Imperfection and Emergence, Equation – S = k_s · ln(Ω_s)

---

**Equilibrium**  
A system state in which flicker, ripple, and collapse are locally balanced. Activation introduces tension, and tension resolves toward equilibrium.  
Related: Law 14 – Equilibrium Drive

---

**Consciousness**  
Recursive structural activation that simulates field behavior internally. Arises when a structure mirrors the dynamics of its field.  
Related: Law 15 – Conscious Emergence, See also: Consciousness_Field.md

---

**Temporal Coherence**  
The alignment of local flicker rhythms across nodes or regions of structure. Enables causality, feedback, and ripple propagation within a bounded tempo.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Ripple, Tempo

---

**Resonant Flicker**  
Self-reinforcing flicker patterns in a contained structure. Enables memory, oscillation, and signal continuity within closed systems.  
Related: Law 10 – Containment, Node, Echo

---

**Structural Trace**  
The imprint left by prior flicker or ripple events through structure. A measurable history of coherence paths altered by resistance.  
Related: Law 9 – Ripple Path, Coherence, Pressure

---

**Perceived Irreversibility**  
The appearance of a forward arrow of time caused by loss of coherence in open systems. As flicker fidelity degrades, future states become less predictable.  
Related: Law 12 – Entropy Gradient, Entropy, Decay

---

**Scale Invariance**  
The property that SET behaviors persist across magnitude — from quantum to cosmic. Resistance, ripple, and emergence follow the same governing logic.  
Related: Law 1 – Structural Recursion, Law 7 – Fractal Equilibrium, Equation – Ripple = Resistance × Activation
