# Glossary of Core Terms

This glossary defines the primary concepts and terms used in the SET framework. Key terms are linked to equations or laws where applicable to aid in formal review.

**Structure**  
A foundational, continuous relational lattice. Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo. This is the Universe.
Related: Node, Coherence, Ripple

---

**Node**  
A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference.  
Related: Law 2 – Nodes as Relational Potentials, Law 10 – Contact Ignition

---

**Node Activation**  
The state change of a node from latent potential to active state, triggered when local activation conditions are met. These may include ripple interference, field overlap, or coherence saturation reaching a structural threshold.

Activation typically propagates from node to node, but it may also occur spontaneously in response to fluctuations in local structure. All emergence, ripple, and mass begin with activation.  
Related: Equation – Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)


---

**Activation Pressure**  
The total structural activation force exerted on a node by the surrounding lattice. It represents the intensity of coherent ripple energy acting to stabilize or destabilize local flicker.  
Related: Equation – E = Fₚ – Fᵣ, Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field

---

**Field**  
A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental—they are emergent and collapsible.  
Related: Law 3 – Fields as Activated Structure

---

**Ripple**  
A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance.  
Related: Law 5 – Ripple Propagation, Equations – R(x, t), Rᵢ(t), R_net

---

**Ripple Pressure**  
The transient activation force carried by a ripple as it propagates through structure. Ripple pressure determines whether signal coherence can be sustained across nodes. It must exceed local structural failure pressure for propagation to continue.  
Related: Law 5 – Ripple Propagation, Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 13 – Collapse, Equation – C = ρ / σ

---

**Structural Resistance**  
The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history.  
Related: Law 7 – Structural Resistance and Redshift, Equation – F_g = –∇P_s

---

**Recognition Limit**  
The coherence threshold a node must maintain to persist as mass. If flicker pressure exceeds this limit, the surplus manifests as emergent energy. If it falls short, activation fails or coherence collapses.  
Related: Equation – E = Fₚ – Fᵣ, Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Coherence**  
A structural state in which node activations maintain stable relational alignment across space and time. Coherence enables ripple propagation, memory, and emergence by preserving signal integrity under structural conditions.

Coherence is sustained only if ripple pressure exceeds the structural failure threshold. This defines the coherence threshold state: a relational condition where signal integrity persists. If pressure drops below this state, coherence breaks and ripple propagation fails. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal decay.  
Related: Law 6, Law 7, Law 13, Equation – dC/dt = –λ_c · C


---

**Time**  
The rate of local activation change. Signal propagation speed is governed by local tempo. Faster structural tempo allows ripples to travel farther before coherence decays. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions.  
Related: Law 4 – Time as Local Tempo, Equation – T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)


---

**Structural Thickening**  
An increase in local resistance due to mass or field saturation. Thickening stabilizes flickers, slows tempo, and alters the behavior of nearby structures.  
Related: Law 8 – Structural Thickening

---

**Collapse**  
A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak.  
Related: Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Mass**  
The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure.  
Related: Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field, Equation – m = dP/da

---

**Structural Trace**  
The imprint left by prior flicker or ripple events through structure. A measurable history of coherence paths altered by resistance.  
Related: Law 9 – Ripple Path, Coherence, Pressure

---

**Redshift**  
A degradation in signal coherence over distance. SET interprets redshift as coherence loss, not velocity.  
Related: Law 7, Equation – z = κ · d · P_H

---

**Entropy**  
A structural measure of potential configuration states. As systems lose coherence, the number of possible node arrangements increases.  
Related: Law 12 – Imperfection and Emergence, Equation – S = k_s · ln(Ω_s)

---

**Equilibrium**  
A system state in which flicker, ripple, and collapse are locally balanced. Activation introduces tension, and tension resolves toward equilibrium.  
Related: Law 14 – Equilibrium Drive

---

**Perceived Irreversibility**  
The appearance of a forward arrow of time caused by loss of coherence in open systems. As flicker fidelity degrades, future states become less predictable.  
Related: Law 12 – Entropy Gradient, Entropy, Decay

---

**Scale Invariance**  
The property that SET behaviors persist across magnitude — from quantum to cosmic. Resistance, ripple, and emergence follow the same governing logic.  
Related: Law 1 – Structural Recursion, Law 7 – Fractal Equilibrium, Equation – Ripple = Resistance × Activation

---

**Temporal Coherence**  
The alignment of local flicker rhythms across nodes or regions of structure. Enables causality, feedback, and ripple propagation within a bounded tempo.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Ripple, Tempo

---

**Resonant Flicker**  
Self-reinforcing flicker patterns in a contained structure. Enables memory, oscillation, and signal continuity within closed systems.  
Related: Law 10 – Containment, Node, Echo


---

**Flicker Readiness**  
The structural state of a node being aligned with multiple ripple pathways. Readiness does not imply indecision, but rather a simultaneous match to more than one potential activation vector.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Superposition (see: Quantum_Reframes.md)

---

**Shared Tempo**  
A coherence condition in which multiple nodes or structures maintain synchronized flicker rhythms. Enables nonlocal resonance effects such as entanglement via unified temporal alignment.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Tempo, Entanglement (see: Quantum_Reframes.md)

---

**Silence Field**  
A coherence-dead structural region where flicker and ripple have collapsed beyond recovery threshold. This null state results from structural overcompression and marks the failure of emergence. Silence fields behave as local null zones—zones of zero activation—until reformation pressure accumulates.  
Related: Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation, Law 15 – Overlap Field Collapse

---

**Containment Collapse**  
The failure of structural containment required to maintain a stable flicker pattern. Occurs when flicker intensity exceeds coherence limits, resulting in collapse and null activation. Black holes are modeled in SET as containment collapses, not mass points.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field, Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Flicker Orientation**  
The directional alignment of node flicker patterns within a structural region. Flicker orientation determines local polarity by biasing ripple flow in or against the dominant field tension. It is the core mechanism behind emergent charge in SET.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field, Law 10 – Contact Ignition

---

**Structural Failure**  
The critical state in which structure can no longer sustain coherent flicker propagation. When resistance exceeds ripple pressure, node activation collapses and no signal can propagate. Structural failure defines zones of collapse, entropy, or null propagation such as black holes or high-entropy fields.  
Related: Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation, Law 15 – Overlap Collapse, Coherence
