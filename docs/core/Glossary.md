# Glossary of Core Terms

This glossary defines the primary concepts and terms used in the SET framework. Key terms are linked to equations or laws where applicable to aid in formal review.

**Structure**  
A foundational, continuous relational lattice. Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo.  
Related: Node, Coherence, Ripple

---

**Node**  
A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference.  
Related: Law 2 – Nodes as Relational Potentials, Law 10 – Contact Ignition

---

**Activation**  
The state change of a node from potential to active due to structural contact. All emergence, ripple, or mass begins with activation.  
Related: Equation – Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)

---

**Field**  
A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental—they are emergent and collapsible.  
Related: Law 3 – Fields as Activated Structure

---

**Ripple**  
A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance.  
Related: Law 5 – Ripple Propagation, Equations – R(x, t), Rᵢ(t), R_net

---

**Structural Resistance**  
The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history.  
Related: Law 7 – Structural Resistance and Redshift, Equation – F_g = –∇P_s

---

**Flicker**  
A localized, rhythmic node oscillation caused by stabilized interference. Flickers are the basis of coherent emergence (e.g., mass, time).  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence

---

**Flicker Pressure**  
The total structural activation force exerted on a node by the surrounding lattice. It represents the intensity of coherent ripple energy acting to stabilize or destabilize local flicker.  
Related: Equation – E = Fₚ – Fᵣ, Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field

---

**Recognition Limit**  
The coherence threshold a node must maintain to persist as mass. If flicker pressure exceeds this limit, the surplus manifests as emergent energy. If it falls short, activation fails or coherence collapses.  
Related: Equation – E = Fₚ – Fᵣ, Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Coherence**  
The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain internal rhythm across space. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal death.  
Related: Law 6, Law 7, Law 13, Equation – dC/dt = –λ_c · C

---

**Tempo**  
The rate of local activation change. Time is not absolute—it is the rhythm of structural behavior. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions.  
Related: Law 4 – Time as Local Tempo, Equation – T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)

---

**Structural Thickening**  
An increase in local resistance due to mass or field saturation. Thickening stabilizes flickers, slows tempo, and alters the behavior of nearby structures.  
Related: Law 8 – Structural Thickening

---

**Collapse**  
A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak.  
Related: Law 13 – Collapse and Field Reformation

---

**Mass**  
The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure.  
Related: Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field, Equation – m = dP/da

---

**Structural Trace**  
The imprint left by prior flicker or ripple events through structure. A measurable history of coherence paths altered by resistance.  
Related: Law 9 – Ripple Path, Coherence, Pressure

---

**Redshift**  
A degradation in signal coherence over distance. SET interprets redshift as coherence loss, not velocity.  
Related: Law 7, Equation – z = κ · d · P_H

---

**Entropy**  
A structural measure of potential configuration states. As systems lose coherence, the number of possible node arrangements increases.  
Related: Law 12 – Imperfection and Emergence, Equation – S = k_s · ln(Ω_s)

---

**Equilibrium**  
A system state in which flicker, ripple, and collapse are locally balanced. Activation introduces tension, and tension resolves toward equilibrium.  
Related: Law 14 – Equilibrium Drive

---

**Perceived Irreversibility**  
The appearance of a forward arrow of time caused by loss of coherence in open systems. As flicker fidelity degrades, future states become less predictable.  
Related: Law 12 – Entropy Gradient, Entropy, Decay

---

**Scale Invariance**  
The property that SET behaviors persist across magnitude — from quantum to cosmic. Resistance, ripple, and emergence follow the same governing logic.  
Related: Law 1 – Structural Recursion, Law 7 – Fractal Equilibrium, Equation – Ripple = Resistance × Activation

---

**Temporal Coherence**  
The alignment of local flicker rhythms across nodes or regions of structure. Enables causality, feedback, and ripple propagation within a bounded tempo.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Ripple, Tempo

---

**Resonant Flicker**  
Self-reinforcing flicker patterns in a contained structure. Enables memory, oscillation, and signal continuity within closed systems.  
Related: Law 10 – Containment, Node, Echo


---

**Flicker Readiness**  
The structural state of a node being aligned with multiple ripple pathways. Readiness does not imply indecision, but rather a simultaneous match to more than one potential activation vector.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Superposition (see: Quantum_Reframes.md)

---

**Shared Tempo**  
A coherence condition in which multiple nodes or structures maintain synchronized flicker rhythms. Enables nonlocal resonance effects such as entanglement via unified temporal alignment.  
Related: Law 6 – Flicker Coherence, Tempo, Entanglement (see: Quantum_Reframes.md)
