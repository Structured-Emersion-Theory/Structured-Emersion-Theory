Glossary of Core Terms – Structured Emersion Theory (SET)

This glossary defines the primary concepts and terms used in the SET framework.

---

Structure  
A foundational, continuous relational lattice. Not a background or substrate, but the totality of all potential node interactions. The source of coherence, resistance, and tempo.

Node  
A unit of dormant relational potential. It has no location or measurement until activated. Node activation occurs through field contact or ripple interference.

Field  
A temporary activation pattern among nodes. Fields form when multiple node activations create tension networks. They are not fundamental—they are emergent and collapsible.

Activation  
The state change of a node from potential to active due to structural contact. All emergence, ripple, or mass begins with activation.

Ripple  
A cascade of node activations across the structure. Ripples transmit pattern, not force. They can interfere, decay, or stabilize depending on structural resistance.

Flicker  
A localized, rhythmic node oscillation caused by stabilized interference. Flickers are the basis of coherent emergence (e.g., mass, time).

Coherence  
The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain internal rhythm across space. Coherence loss results in redshift, collapse, or signal death.

Tempo  
The rate of local activation change. Time is not absolute—it is the rhythm of structural behavior. Dilation is a difference in tempo across regions.

Collapse  
A failure of coherence due to overloaded structural tension. Collapse may result in a null zone (black hole), field reformation, or radiation leak.

Structural Resistance  
The measure of how much effort is required for a ripple to maintain coherence across a region. Resistance varies based on structure density and interference history.

Mass  
The structural cost of maintaining a stable flicker pattern. It is not a substance, but a consequence of containment within the structure.

Structural Thickening  
An increase in local resistance and flicker stability due to nearby mass or field density. Thickened zones stabilize or trap form.

Emergence  
The appearance of measurable form or behavior due to the interaction of activated nodes. All observable phenomena in SET are emergent.

Equilibrium  
The structural drive to minimize internal tension. Ripples, flickers, and collapse all seek to restore equilibrium through form or dissipation.

Consciousness  
A recursive structure capable of simulating field behavior internally. Consciousness arises when a system mirrors the activation logic of the structure itself.
