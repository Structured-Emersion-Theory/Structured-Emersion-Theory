# The Laws of Structure

Each law is paired with its corresponding mathematical representation where applicable. These links provide falsifiable anchors for SET’s claims and offer clear traceability from concept to equation.

## Law 1 – Existence as Emergence
Nothing exists independently. All observable phenomena emerge from the interaction of structure.

- (Related: Ripple interference and macrofield formation — `R_net`, `I(x, t)`, macro thresholds)

---

## Law 2 – Nodes as Relational Potentials
A node is a unit of dormant potential that becomes active only through interaction. It has no fixed position in time or space until activated.

- (Related: Node activation — `Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)`)

---

## Law 3 – Fields as Activated Structure
Fields are not background substrates. They are coherent activation patterns among nodes, forming temporary structural tension networks.

- (Related: Field interference — `I(x, t) = Σ [Rᵢ · Rⱼ]`)
- (Related: Energy in coherence fields — `E = P_s · V · γ`)

---

## Law 4 – Time
Time is not a dimension. It is the local rate of relational activation. Time differs between regions due to structural pressure, density, or interference.

- (Related: Time dilation — `T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)`)

---

## Law 5 – Ripple Propagation
Ripples are cascading node activations. They carry no mass or charge—only interference potential. Ripple stability defines field strength.

- (Related: Ripple dynamics — `R(x, t) = α · (∂A/∂t) · (C / S)`)
- (Related: Ripple decay — `Rᵢ(t) = Rᵢ(t–1) · e^(–λ · Δt)`)

---

## Law 6 – Structural Coherence
Coherence is the sustained alignment of node activations that allows ripple propagation across structure. It is maintained when ripple pressure is sufficient to overcome local structural resistance.

- (Related: Activation threshold — `Θ(Σ R_in – A_threshold) · Θ(C – C_min)`)
- (Related: Kinetic energy of Activation mass — `E_k = (1/2) · m · v²`)

---

## Law 7 – Structural Resistance and Redshift
Redshift is not caused by recession velocity. It is a degradation of coherence due to structural resistance. Light does not stretch—it loses integrity over distance.

- (Related: Structural redshift — `z = (λ_obs – λ₀)/λ₀ = κ · d · P_H`)
- (Related: Time dilation from structure — `T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)`)

---

## Law 8 – Structural Thickening
Massive objects increase structural resistance in their vicinity. This thickening stabilizes node activation slows time, and allows form to persist in orbit.

- (Related: Resistance-dependent time — `T_local`)
- (Related: Pressure-based gravity — `F_g = –∇P_s`)

---

## Law 9 – Mass as Containment Field
Mass is not intrinsic. It is the resistance to node activation.

- (Related: Mass from resistance — `m = dP/da`)
- (Related: Potential energy — `E_p = P_s · d_s`)

---

## Law 10 – The Coherence Horizon
The boundary of the observable universe is determined by loss of coherence—not by light speed or expansion. Moving the observer changes the coherence limit.

- (Related: Redshift scaling and boundary logic — `z = κ · d · P_H`)

---

## Law 11 – Collapse and Field Reformation
When coherence exceeds threshold limits, local collapse occurs. Collapse is not destruction, but restructuring toward a new activation state.

- (Related: Coherence decay — `dC/dt = –λ_c · C`)
- Collapse initiates when coherence \( C \) falls below sustainable thresholds, triggering reformation based on local structure.

---

## Law 12 – Equilibrium
All structural systems move toward equilibrium. Activation introduces tension; tension propagates or resolves through node activation, ripple, or collapse.

- (Related: Ripple & collapse balancing — `R(x, t)`, `dC/dt`)
