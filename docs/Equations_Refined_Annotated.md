## Node Activation & Behavior

- `Aᵢ(t) = μ · φ(x, t) · e^(–γt)` — Node activation depends on local field potential φ, decay rate γ, and a structural coefficient μ. *(Law 2: Node Potential, Law 9: Contact Ignition)*
- `If Σ R_in ≥ A_threshold and C ≥ C_min → Flicker` — Nodes activate (flicker) when incoming ripple strength exceeds structural and coherence thresholds. *(Law 9: Contact Ignition, Law 14: Universal Structure)*

## Ripple Dynamics

- `R(x, t) = α · (∂A/∂t) · (C(x, t) / S(x))` — Ripple amplitude from activation change rate, local coherence, and structural resistance. *(Law 5: Causality as Activation Flow)*
- `Rᵢ(t) = Rᵢ(t–1) · e^(–λ · Δt)` — Ripple decay over time unless reinforced. *(Law 7: Entropy as Tension Decay)*
- `R_net = Σ [Rⱼ · cos(Δθⱼ)]` — Net ripple from multiple sources based on alignment phase angle. *(Law 5: Flow of Activation)*
- `I(x, t) = Σ [Rᵢ(x, t) · Rⱼ(x, t)]` — Ripple interference at spacetime point. *(Law 3: Fields as Activated Relationships)*
- `If Σ Rᵢ(t) ≥ F_macro within Δτ_c → Macrofield Emergence` — If total ripple exceeds threshold in a time window, a macrofield stabilizes. *(Law 1: Existence as Emergence)*

## Tempo & Time

- `T_local = T₀ / (1 + R)` — Local tempo as a function of structural resistance. *(Law 4: Time as Relational Tempo)*
- `∂C/∂t < 0 and C → 0` — Collapse occurs when coherence decays toward zero. *(Law 13: Equilibrium Drive, Law 12: Density Collapse & Reformation)*

---

## Mass & Structural Containment

- `M = ∫₀^d κ · C_f(x) dx` — Mass as accumulated coherence resistance over containment span. *(Law 6: Space as Constructed Topology, Law 9: Contact Ignition)*
- `m_f = F_flicker / a_structure` — Flicker-based mass derived from alignment force over structural area. *(Law 14: Universal Structure)*

## Energy Forms

- `E_k = (1/2) · m_f · v_f²` — Kinetic energy of structured mass under ripple velocity. *(Law 5: Activation Flow)*
- `E_p = P · d_s` — Potential energy as structural pressure over relational distance. *(Law 14: Universal Structure)*
- `𝓡(x, t) = Σ [Aᵢ · sin(ωᵢ t + θᵢ) · Cᵢ]` — Resonance from node activations oscillating in coherence. *(Law 3: Fields as Activated Relationships)*

---

## Collapse & Field Reformation

- `If ρ(x, t) ≥ ρ_c and C(x, t) < C_min → Structural Collapse` — Collapse triggered by density threshold with insufficient coherence. *(Law 12: Density Collapse & Reformation)*
- `dE_residual/dt = –λ · E_residual` — Residual energy decay over time. *(Law 7: Entropy)*
- `Ψ(x, t) = E_residual · κ(x, t)` — Bounce-back condition from residual energy and resistance. *(Law 13: Equilibrium Drive)*
- `If Ψ ≥ Ψ_min → Structure reforms, nodes reconnect` — Bounce threshold for reactivation. *(Law 13: Equilibrium Drive, Law 1: Emergence)*

## Consciousness & Thresholds

- `C_r = n · η · γ ≥ Θ_c` — Recursive consciousness emerges if node count, efficiency, and feedback exceed threshold. *(Law 8: Observation as Participation, Law 15: Conscious Structure)*

---

## Redshift & Cosmological Pressure

- `κ = Δλ / Δd` — Coherence drag interpreted as wavelength shift over spatial change. *(Law 7: Resistance, Law 11: Coherence Horizon)*
- `z = (λ_obs – λ₀) / λ₀ = κ · d · P_H` — Redshift as structural resistance product, not expansion. *(Law 7: Entropy, Law 14: Universal Structure)*
- `z = f(κ · d)` — Generalized redshift as function of coherence drag and structural distance. *(Law 11: Coherence Horizon)*

---

## Structural Pressure & Force

- `P = F / A` — Structural pressure from force over node activation area. *(Law 14: Universal Structure)*

---

## Simulation Logic (Rules)

- `Ripple Update Rule:` If Σ R_in ≥ A_threshold and C ≥ C_min → Flicker → send ripple to neighbors and log time/memory. *(Law 9: Contact Ignition, Law 1: Emergence)*
