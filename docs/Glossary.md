# Glossary – Structured Emersion Theory

**Node** – A unit of dormant relational potential. Activates through field interaction.

**Field** – A temporary activation pattern of nodes that creates structure.

**Activation** – The emergence of relational tension between nodes.

**Tempo** – The rhythm or local rate of relational change.

**Collapse** – Destructive interference of fields that cancels tempo.

**Emergence** – The appearance of observable structure through interaction.

**Ripple** – A chain reaction of node activations cascading through structure.

**Consciousness** – Recursive node activation capable of tuning, recalling, or projecting fields.

**Overlap Zone** – An unstable region where multiple fields interfere.

**Null Field** – A region of canceled or zero-tempo potential.
