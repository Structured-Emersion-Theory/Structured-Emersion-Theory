## Glossary Candidate Extracts

### Scale Invariance  
SET principles apply across all structural scales.  
Quantum behavior and cosmological patterns emerge from the same mechanisms operating at different tempo intensities.

**Suggested Glossary Tag:** `scale_invariance`

---

### Simulation Potential  
SET can be represented in purely structural and mathematical terms.  
It does not require particles, traditional fields, or external forces to describe observed behavior.

**Suggested Glossary Tag:** `simulation_potential`

## Original Definitions (Retained for Context)

- **Universal Structure**: A foundational, continuous relational lattice. Not a medium or backdrop, but the totality of node interaction. Source of coherence, resistance, and tempo.  
- **Node**: A unit of dormant relational potential. Possesses no position or identity until activated through interaction.  
- **Activation**: The process by which a node transitions from potential to active. The necessary condition for any emergent phenomena.  
- **Field**: A temporary pattern of active nodes maintained through tension. Emergent, not fundamental.  
- **Ripple**: A sequential cascade of node activations transmitting structural pattern. Can interfere constructively or destructively.  
- **Flicker**: A stabilized oscillation from ripple interference. Responsible for coherence, form, and rhythmic behavior.  
- **Tempo**: Local rate of change in activation. Defines what we perceive as time. Modulated by resistance and density.  
- **Coherence**: The ability of a ripple or flicker to maintain pattern integrity across distance or time. Loss of coherence results in collapse, redshift, or decoherence.  
- **Mass**: The structural cost of maintaining flicker coherence. Not a substanceâ€”an emergent containment state.  
- **Structural Resistance**: Opposition within structure to ripple propagation. Defines light drag, redshift, and collapse thresholds.  
- **Structural Thickening**: Increased resistance near dense or active regions. Stabilizes nearby form and modulates tempo.  
- **Containment**: The structural condition that maintains flickers in fixed formation. Mass, orbit, and fields result from containment behavior.  
- **Collapse**: The failure of coherence under pressure. Results in null zones (e.g. black holes), reformation, or radiation bleed.  
- **Reformation**: Post-collapse reconfiguration. Can result in rebounding fields, new patterns, or emergence of different zones.  
- **Equilibrium Drive**: All tension-based patterns resolve toward minimal structure. Decay, orbit, and collapse reflect this drive.  
- **Scale Invariance**: [see above]  
- **Simulation Potential**: [see above]  
- **Consciousness**: A recursive simulation system capable of modeling structure. Defined by feedback, internal tempo control, and prediction.  
- **Participation**: To observe is to engage. Conscious structures alter local activation behavior.
